Performance Evaluation of Channel Estimation Techniques under Doppler Effects in IEEE 802.11 Rician Channels 

This study evaluates three channel estimation techniques—MATLAB's built-in LS-based estimator, standalone LS, and MMSE—within the IEEE 802.11 Wi-Fi standard. Simulations in Rician and AWGN channels across varying Doppler shifts show similar performance among the estimators, with MMSE performing best and LS worst. All estimators suffer significant BER degradation beyond 1700 Hz Doppler. Reducing packet payload size improved preamble-based estimation at higher Doppler but remains impractical. The IEEE 802.11 standard, designed for static or low-mobility environments, is unsuitable for high-Doppler scenarios like LEO satellite communications. Optimized OFDM-based standards are needed to address such challenges.
